# SwiftNeuralNetwork

This is roughly based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU and other learning materials such as:
- 3Blue1Brown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk
- Sebastian Lague: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c


There are much better ways of doing what I'm doing here, like using `Accelerate`'s `BNNS` APIs, or `CoreML`. This was very much a learning excercise for me.
